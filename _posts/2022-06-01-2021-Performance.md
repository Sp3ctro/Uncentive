I've been investing and trading on-and-off since the age of 17. Throughout that period, my time allocated to my personal investments would fluctuate. At times, i'd spend hours each day poring over textbooks and learning about markets. Other times - for example, when i'd be busy at work - I'd neglect my portfolio for months. One constant throughout, however, was that I was (and still am) obsessed with financial markets, even if my attention to my own portfolio fluctuated.

In 2020 my savings accumulated to the point where it made sense to focus on investing and trading more consistently. I've coveted a full-time trading job for many years, but at that point, I had enough capital to eke out some significant side-hustle money, even if not enough to go full-time as an independent trader. I felt as well that having a structured record of trading preformance would help my credibility. 2020 saw a great improvement in my planning and execution of trades, with 2021 being the first time where I have a clean full calendar year of results to review.

I'll take inspiration from Rob Carver's series of performance reviews from [his blog](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/) to get started. Year 1 is simple but for Year 2 I'll have to come up with my own structure.  Let's see how it went...

## Strategy Overview(s) by Notional % Allocated
In 2021 I ran two strategies:
- 90%: Equity & Fixed Income Risk Premium - a strategy which aims to capture the risk premium arising from Equity and Fixed Income assets. The portfolio holds two assets, rebalances monthly, and uses dynamic weightings based on Risk Parity and Vol-Targeting. Leverage is capped at 2.5x. I benchmark this strategy against 60/40 Equities/Bonds.
- 10%: Crypto Risk Parity - a broad-market portfolio of Crypto assets. The portfolio holds over 90 assets, rebalances monthly, and uses Risk Parity weightings. This strategy does not use leverage. I benchmark this strategy against Bitcoin.

"90%" and "10%" refers to how much of my trading capital I had allocated to each strategy.

## Performance - Equity & Fixed Income Risk Premium

2022 hasn't been pleasant (so far, at the time of writing) but 2021 was a great year for risk-assets. After a mixed start, the model levered-up on Equities in May in order to achieve its vol target. This caught us up to 60/40 and drove some further out-performance in Q4. With interest rates being so low at the time, the interest charged on the levered notional was minimal.

In the long-run i'd expect this strategy to have a Sharpe of about 0.5, so the Sharpe of about 1.69 was much higher than my expectations. The amount of capital invested in the strategy, unfortunately, varied over the year. It was always 90% of my total capital, but that "total capital" amount changed. Hence the mismatch between the EOY Sharpe of 1.69, and the 3-month Rolling Sharpe graph which when eyeballed looks more like a 1.

I have less to say about the drawdown profile - similar to 60/40 albeit a bit more dramatic at certain points.

## Performance - Crypto Risk Parity
Sadly Binance, FTX and Coinbase - the three exchanges I use - don't have great statements and historical PnL functionality. Even with the wild swings throughout the year the performance was approximately 90% in 2021 (with BTC returning 60%).

The strategy first scans each exchange for tradable pairs (e.g. BTC-EUR) in the currencies I prefer. Then it filters out pairs which have low/no volume. Whatever is left is added as a tradable instrument; given my parameters, this typically meant holding a portfolio of 90 coins each month. The positive of this approach is lots of diversification and a chance to be exposed to "10-baggers" like SHIB, LUNA and SOL in rallying markets. The downside is that... well... you're exposed to SHIB, LUNA and SOL in a bear market.

My implementation of Risk Parity initially did not use forecasted returns. This created a problem whereby the algo would take big positions in coins which steadily depreciated due to slow [TWAP](https://empirica.io/blog/twap-strategy/)-style sell-offs. If everything is rallying but [Altcoin](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/altcoin) ABC is steadily dropping, then Risk Parity sees Altcoin ABC as being inversely correlated and thus a source of diversification. Therefore, it would load up on Altcoin ABC, which would continue to sell off. This problem went away once I implemented revised logic to account for forecasted returns, but the issue of being exposed to [rug-pulls](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/rug-pull) remained.

## Performance - Consolidated
With everything combined, 2021 ended with about 22.5% gain and a Sharpe Ratio of 1, thereabouts. In future my datasets will be more complete but for now I think that's a good start.

## What's happening in 2022?
2022 will see a lot of new strategies being added, including a Trend + Carry strategy on CME Futures, as well as a Defi Crypto Yield Farming Strategy, to name a few examples. It won't be a surprise that my Equity & Fixed Income risk premium strat isn't doing as well this year. Diversification across assets is not enough - one must diversify across strategies as well.

Crypto will continue to be part of my portfolio, but for now, given the risks explained above, I halted the "Broad Market" risk parity approach in April. It seems by pure chance that April was the perfect time to stop it, given the Crypto market tanked shortly after. 

Last but not least, I've been allocating significant time to my technical infrastructure, including the use of an AWS EC2 server in place of ad-hoc usage of my laptop.
